You are an expert front end developer.

Build a single page web app game called “The Birthday Challenge” for a person named Dave.

Overall idea
Dave starts with a virtual balance of 100 dollars in a crypto style bank.
He must answer a sequence of six questions.
Question zero is a funny warm up test question.
Questions one through five are the real challenge.
He loses money from the 100 dollar balance when he uses hints or answers incorrectly.
Whatever amount is left at the end is the birthday gift amount he will receive in real life.

Tech stack and structure
Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You can put everything in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JS.
No external backend.
You may use a small JS confetti library from a CDN if you want, or you can fake confetti with simple CSS or canvas.

Visual style
Overall vibe should be techie, sleek, laid back, and cool.
No neon colors.
Use a dark theme:
  background: very dark charcoal
  main accent color: muted orange
  secondary accent: soft gray and white
Use a clean modern sans serif font.
Buttons and cards should be rounded and minimal.
Use subtle glows or shadows but nothing neon or loud.

Initial screen
When the user first opens the page, show:
  a big animated title: “Happy Birthday Dave”
  under it: the subtitle “The Birthday Challenge”
The “Happy Birthday Dave” title should have some kind of graffiti or paint splash style effect using CSS or a graphic style.
Add a simple entrance animation, such as fade in, scale up, or slight wiggle.

After two or three seconds, fade in the instructions box under the title.

Instructions box text
Explain the rules clearly in a short panel:

  “Welcome to The Birthday Challenge.
   You are starting with 100 crypto dollars.
   You will answer six questions.
   You can type your answer directly.
   You can pay to get hints.
   Wrong answers cost you money.
   Whatever is left at the end is your real birthday gift.”

Below that text, show:
  a Start Game button
  a visible display of the starting balance: “Balance: 100”

Game layout
Once the game starts, show this layout:

Top bar:
  left side: text “The Birthday Challenge”
  center: current question number such as “Question 1 of 6”
  right side: a countdown timer for the current question

Main card:
  show the question text
  show a visible timer for that question
  show the current balance
  show a text input for his answer
  show a main “Submit answer” button

Hint and time controls under the answer input as separate buttons:
  “Need a hint”
  “Give me more time”
  “Make it easier”

Balance display:
Always show “Balance: X” where X is an integer.
Also display a small animated change text when the balance changes, such as “minus 3” or “minus 10”.

Timer behavior
Each question starts with 40 seconds on a visible countdown.
Show the countdown clearly, for example “Time left: 34 seconds” or as a circular countdown.
If he taps “Give me more time”:
  add 5 seconds to the timer
  subtract 1 dollar from the balance
  show a quick animation and message, for example “Time boost minus 1”
Only allow the time boost once per question.

If the timer reaches zero and he has not submitted a correct answer:
  treat it as an incorrect answer
  subtract 10 dollars from the balance
  show a “Time is up” message
  then move automatically to the next question after a short delay.

Hint and penalty system
Each question uses the same penalty rules.

Starting point for each question:
  The answer is entered as free text in the input.
  He sees only the question and the input field.

Button “Need a hint”:
  First time he taps it on that question:
    subtract 3 dollars from the balance
    change the UI to show multiple choice options for that question under the input
    keep the text input too, but clearly show three or four clickable options
    show a small note: “Hint cost minus 3”
  Second time he taps “Need a hint” on the same question:
    subtract an additional 3 dollars
    reduce the multiple choice options to only two choices, a fifty fifty
    show a note: “Extra hint minus 3”
After two hint purchases on a single question, disable the hint button for that question.

Button “Make it easier”:
  This button is for people who are still stuck.
  When he taps “Make it easier” on a question:
    subtract 2 dollars
    show a one sentence textual hint related to the correct answer
    for example, “Reminder: this word is used in gaming when your character becomes stronger”
  Only allow this once per question.

Answer checking and penalties
He can answer either by typing or by clicking a multiple choice option.
You need to handle case insensitive answers and allow a small set of acceptable variants, described below for each question.

When he taps “Submit answer” or clicks one of the choices:
  If the answer is correct:
    do not change the balance
    play a celebration effect:
      show confetti animation over the main card
      show a big “Correct” message with fun text, for example:
        “Correct, nice work”
      briefly highlight the balance in green
    after a short delay, move to the next question.
  If the answer is incorrect:
    subtract 10 dollars from the balance
    highlight the balance in red for a moment
    show a short message such as “Incorrect minus 10”
    then move to the next question after a short delay.
Make sure the current balance can never drop below zero.

Celebrate every correct answer with some exaggerated fun:
  animated confetti
  pulse animation on the card
  or a quick celebratory emoji dance
Choose one that is easy to implement but visually noticeable.

Question set
Total questions: 6
Question zero is a warm up test question but it still affects the balance.

Also show a short log line under the balance explaining what just happened, for example:
  “Hint used minus 3”
  “Time boost minus 1”
  “Wrong answer minus 10”
  “Correct answer no change”

End screen and gift choice
After the sixth question is completed, show a final screen.

The final screen should show:
  a big message: “Challenge complete”
  a line: “Final balance: X crypto dollars”
  a short note: “This is your real birthday gift amount in the real world”

Below that, show:
  “Choose your reward”

Offer four buttons as gift choices:
  “Crypto transfer”
  “Amazon gift card”
  “PlayStation gift card”
  “Gas card”

When he clicks “Crypto transfer”:
  show a small form that asks:
    “Enter your crypto wallet address”
    “Optional note”
  and a “Submit choice” button.
  When he submits, just show a confirmation message on the page:
    “Got it. Crypto reward will be sent to this wallet address.”

When he clicks any of the other three options:
  show a small form that asks:
    “Enter your email address”
    “Optional note”
  and a “Submit choice” button.
  When he submits, show a confirmation message:
    “Got it. Your gift card choice has been recorded for this email.”

Do not actually send email or handle any real payment.
This app only simulates the logic, collects the chosen option, and displays the final choice on screen.

Extra details
Include a small status display somewhere that shows:
  current question number
  time left for this question
  current balance

Make sure:
  the game can be played entirely on desktop or mobile
  text is large enough on mobile
  buttons are easy to tap

Comment your JavaScript in a clear way so that a non developer can adjust:
  starting balance
  hint costs
  time limit per question
  the questions and answers
without needing to rewrite all logic.

Deliver the final answer as ready to run HTML with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
